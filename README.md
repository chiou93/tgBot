We have created a telegram bot that knows how to say hello, be interested in the state of your affairs and display information about the user: ID and nickname.

Created two .bat files:

**server.bat** - to quickly launch the bot when you need to open/close.

**console.bat** - console, if server.bat is closed, then open console.bat

Created two .py files:

**configure.py** - the token and the name of our bot are stored here.

**bot.py** - our bot's code is stored here.
